# COAST_and_SINK_methodology
COAST and SINK are complementary methods for structured idea creation and adversarial interrogation using preserved AI transcripts.
## **What This Repository Contains**

This repository contains two related but distinct things:

**COAST**, a method for creating structured ideas, and

**SINK**, a method for interrogating, stress-testing, and distributing those ideas using adversarial AI and preserved transcripts.

They are designed to work together, but they are not the same thing.

COAST is about **making an idea legible**.

SINK is about **finding out whether that idea survives contact with reality**.

The packet included here documents both methods as they currently exist. Nothing in this repository is a product, platform, or finished system. It is a set of practices, made explicit.

## **Why This Exists**

Most modern knowledge work is optimized for speed, persuasion, and confidence. Ideas are published quickly, rewarded for clarity and conviction, and rarely revisited once they enter circulation. The result is not a lack of intelligence, but a lack of *interrogation*. Assumptions go unstated. Tradeoffs remain implicit. Disagreement becomes performative rather than productive.

This work exists to slow that process down in a specific way.

It is an attempt to make thinking visible: to separate creation from testing, to preserve uncertainty, and to leave records of how ideas were challenged rather than only how they were presented.

## **COAST: Structured Creation**

COAST is a creation methodology. It is used to turn raw material — notes, articles, intuitions, research, observations — into a structured artifact that can be examined by others.

A COAST artifact does not attempt to be persuasive or final. Instead, it forces the author to clarify what they are actually claiming, what context they believe matters, what assumptions they are making (knowingly or not), what is at stake if they are wrong, and how they believe the situation might evolve over time.

The purpose of COAST is not to guarantee correctness. Its purpose is to ensure that an idea has enough internal structure to be meaningfully interrogated.

Without COAST, interrogation tends to collapse into vibes, rhetoric, or identity conflict. COAST gives disagreement something solid to push against.

## **SINK: Interrogation and Distribution**

SINK is an interrogation and distribution methodology. It is used *after* an idea has been structured.

SINK treats ideas as provisional objects that should be tested from multiple angles, ideally by an adversarial or skeptical intelligence. In practice, this often involves using AI as a questioning instrument — not because the AI is trusted, but because it is tireless, consistent, and capable of challenging framing choices without social pressure.

A core requirement of SINK is transparency. Interrogations are preserved as transcripts. Questions are not hidden. Revisions are not erased. The goal is not to produce a single “correct” answer, but to leave a visible trail showing how an idea was challenged, defended, modified, or left unresolved.

When ideas are shared publicly through SINK, what is distributed is not just a conclusion, but the *process* that led to it.

## **How COAST and SINK Work Together**

COAST and SINK are deliberately separated to prevent shortcutting.

COAST comes first. It forces the author to slow down and make commitments explicit.

SINK comes second. It tests those commitments without mercy.

Keeping these steps distinct is essential. When creation and interrogation blur together, people tend to let tools generate conclusions for them. This repository resists that impulse by design.

Getting Started

If you’re new to this repository:

1. Begin with START_HERE.pdf — it explains the structure of the packet and how to engage with it using AI.
2. For a quick practical entry point, see COAST handout.pdf.
3. To understand the full system conceptually, read Overview_COAST_and_SINK.pdf.

This repository is designed for interrogation, not linear consumption. You are encouraged to question it, test it, and adapt it — that’s the point.

## **About AI Usage**

This work assumes that AI will be used. It also assumes that AI should not be trusted.

Within these methods, AI is treated as an adversarial instrument — a way to surface blind spots, inconsistencies, and missing context. It is not an authority and should never be allowed to author conclusions on a user’s behalf.

Preserving transcripts is not optional. If an idea is interrogated by AI and the record is lost, the interrogation may as well not have happened.

---

## **Scope and Ambition**

This is not an attempt to create a universal framework, a movement, or a replacement for existing institutions. It is offered as **one method among many**, useful in contexts where rigor matters more than speed.

Its realistic use cases are modest: individuals thinking carefully, small teams working through complex questions, or projects where it is important to be able to show how conclusions were reached.

If it spreads beyond that, it will do so through reuse and adaptation, not advocacy.

## **Reuse and Adaptation**

You are free to reuse, modify, or adapt these methods. You may change the questions, rename the stages, or combine them with other approaches.

Attribution is appreciated but not required. If these ideas are useful, they should survive through use, not enforcement.

---

## **A Closing Note**

Both COAST and SINK are intentionally harder than many alternatives.

They slow you down. They expose uncertainty. They make shortcuts visible.

That difficulty is not a flaw. It is the cost of taking ideas seriously.

If that cost feels unnecessary for your work, this method is probably not for you — and that is an acceptable outcome.
